# Run multiple WordPress Docker containers with NGINX Proxy, LetsEncrypt and PHP Composer

Each WordPress site runs its own container and is proxied by an NGINX Proxy that handles SSL thanks to LetsEncrypt.
This setup relies on https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy and https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion

## Requirements

* Docker
* Docker Compose

## NGINX Proxy and LetsEncrypt

Run `docker-compose up -d` in the `nginx` directory to start the NGINX Proxy and LetsEncrypt Proxy
Companion containers. These containers will handle https.  

## WordPress Setup

* Copy the `example` directory for each WordPress site you want to host. I created a copy called `wordpress_02` as an example. If you only want to host one site you can delete `wordpress_02` and modify `wordpress_01` to your liking.

* In each site directory is a `sample.env` - copy that file, edit the environment variables and
rename it to `.env`. Each site directory must contain this environment file.
* Make sure that the container names  are unique for each site. (`DB_CONTAINER, WP_CONTAINER and COMPOSER_CONTAINER`). 
* I recommend highly choosing different database credentials for each site.
* Make optional changes to `wp-config.php`
* The `wp-content` folder is mounted locally to `/srv/www/${VIRTUAL_HOST}/wp_content` for
persistency. This folder contains themes, plugins and uploads.
* Database files are mounted here: `/srv/www/${VIRTUAL_HOST}/db_data`

## Custom Theme & Plugin Development
* You can develop a custom theme in `wordpress_XX/theme` or a custom plugin in
`wordpress_XX/plugin`. Theme and plugin are named after the according environment variable defined in `.env` (`WP_THEME` and `WP_PLUGIN`)

## Composer

Add plugins and/or theme dependencies to `wordpress_XX/composer/composer.json`
They will be installed by the composer container on `docker-compose up --build` I've added common plugins from https://wpackagist.org/ repository as an example.

``` arbitrary
{
    "name": "wordpress-docker-composer",
    "description": "WordPress Docker & Composer Setup",
    "repositories":[
        {
            "type":"composer",
            "url":"https://wpackagist.org"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "wpackagist-plugin/wordpress-seo":"*",
        "wpackagist-plugin/wp-super-cache":"*"
    }
}
```

## Build and run containers. 

For each site navigate to its directory and:

``docker-compose up --build``

## Local Development

For local development set the values of `VIRTUAL_HOST`and `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` environment variables to a arbitrary domain. (e.g. my-wordpress.com) and set `LETSENCRYPT_TEST` to `true`. Make sure to use a valid domain ending and to add the domain to your hosts file. On Linux or MacOS add this line `127.0.0.1    my-wordpress.com` to `/etc/hosts` and restart the browser. On Windows the hosts file is located here - `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
